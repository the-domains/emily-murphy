She told me about a friend of hers who was a writer. She usually wrote novels. When she had little kids she couldn’t do that. It was too hard to complete a thought. Her time was too disjointed and she was always a bit sleep deprived. So she started writing poems. She could complete her thoughts in poetry. I realized that I was basically doing the same thing with my own clay work. I couldn’t make an elaborate thrown and altered teapot or a 36″ tall bottle that needed to be thrown in parts. Or anything else that demanded lots of uninterrupted time and very particular timing. Clay is tricky. Timing is everything. It might not matter that I have an afternoon free in the studio if I don’t have another one for several more weeks. If I can’t get back to finish the pieces I started, what was the point in doing them in the first place? I realized that I needed to focus on smaller pieces that I can finish in a predictable amount of time. Just for now. Accepting that this was what I needed to do was really liberating. If I kept trying to do more than my life would allow, I would always feel like I was failing. But if I keep my expectations realistic, it was oh so satisfying. Bigger pieces that went unfinished were just clay shaped guilt trips. And what fun is that? My studio should be filled with joy, not guilt!
